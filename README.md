## Line Renderer --- Tensorflow

This is line renderer project, intended to be built into the Tensorflow kernel. Bresenham algorithm is used, since the rendering is done in 2-D space. C++ is the language supported by Tensorflow kernel, the code can be found in the **kernels** file.

However, this project is not recommended to be used... The algorithm may cause memory explosion.
